# Core Java

In this module I'll show some core java principles.

## Design patterns
* Interpreter: `Calculator`
* Strategy: `Duck`


# Calculator

As I tried to keep the names of the used classes a close to the GOF design pattern used names of an
Interpreter you can find the Calculator as the `Client` class in the interpreter package.

Note that The unit tests are used to demonstrate the workings of the the used pattern.

# Eend / duck

This `Strategy` pattern I demonstrated for a Dutch audience so sorry but it's in dutch.
I think most of you will understand though.
